Nowadays, more and more companies realize the value of data, especially those collected from their business cycle. Not only can the data help them design products according to the natural clusters identified from their business data, but also it could help them identify certain customer behavior patterns, such as churn/ no-churn. The use of data mining techniques for predicting customer churn is new in the electronic banking context. Similarly, actual reasons behind the customer's churn decision might affect the bank's energy to explore new products or how to allocate the marketing resources

Through this project, we hope to help the business manager understand their customer stratifications and update their product features. Furthermore, we want to use the information we have to identify the characteristics of attrited customers so that the company may come up with marketing strategies to maintain those customers who may end the business relationship with them.
